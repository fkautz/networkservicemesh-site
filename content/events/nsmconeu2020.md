# Schedule

Monday, August 17,2020 -  13:00-20:30 CEST | Virtual

{{% talk time="13:00:00+02" title="Keynote - Anthem Inc." %}}
Edge Infrastructure will cause Enterprise and Service Provider network infrastructure to converge. 
Enterprise networks will integrate seamelessly with Service Providers.
The current techniques do not operationally or technically scale. 
This convergence calls for a new operational and security paradigm.

Network Service Mesh will provide Cloud Native APIs which will help bridge the gap.
These API calls are rooted in the Zero Trust security model which will facilitate federated workload identity.
Once federated identity is established, networks between enterprises and service providers will seamlessly merge while simultaneously providing fine-grained control of resources.

Come join the Network Service Mesh community and help spearhead this important effort!

{{% talk time="13:15:00+02" title="Inside Network Service Mesh" %}}
The Network Service Mesh (NSM) is a novel, ambitious approach to implement cloud native networking. At the core of NSM 
is a set of APIs designed to implement scalable, reliable, on-demand connectivity between Network Service Endpoints. 
Using a systems modeling approach, this talk will shed light on NSM’s APIs and architecture. Together, we shall
untangle the mesh and arrive at a concise and accurate mental model of NSM’s internals, its core components and
their interactions - If you want to know how the Network Service Mesh works, this presentation is for you.

{{% talk time="13:45:00+02" title="A Break From the Past, Why CNFs Must Move Beyond the NFV Mentality" %}}
Cloud native software approaches are infiltrating Telcos at an ever accelerating pace. The conundrum many operators
find themselves faced with, is understanding what it really means to be cloud native, and how these principles
apply to their networks. Adopting legacy approaches from the NFV era forces paradigms onto the network that potentially
erode some if not most of the benefits that making this transition promised in the first place. Technologies such as
NSM present new opportunities for tackling these challenges via adopting cloud native software practices.

{{% talk time="15:00:00+02" title="Using DNS to smooth your NSM adoption" %}}
Network Service Mesh is rapidly evolving to support more complex topologies, especially in hybrid or multicloud 
environments.  In these environments service advertisement and discovery also become significantly more complex.
There are two distinct problems.  The first is discovery of NSM network services by all the NSM deployments.
The second is workload services and endpoints must be discoverable on the NSM created interfaces.   In this
presentation and demo we will show how externaldns (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) integrated with
NSM can meet all the complex service advertisement and discovery issues multicloud environments require. We will go 
into detail on how to configure NSM and NSEs to provide service discovery to the workloads.  Additionally, we will
show how externaldns can be used to register Floating Inter-domain NSRs to allow discovery of NSM network services.

The ability of Network Service Mesh to provide connections between network service clients and endpoints regardless
of their deployment domain is very attractive and exciting for those providing infrastructure for multi-cluster and
multi-cloud applications.  However, NSM’s highly distributed architecture and flexibility in the component
implementations can make it difficult to understand the deployment and usage of an interdomain capable NSM setup.
This talk will walk-through the NSM components involved, various control-plane flows, and domain specific deployment
requirements for interdomain NSM.  We will also introduce some of the control-plane deployment variations, such as
floating interdomain.  Additionally, we will demonstrate an NSM interdomain deployment to highlight component and
domain specific details, as well as, usage with specific clients and endpoints for a network-service.

{{% talk time="17:30:00+02" title="Attesting, Authenticating and Authorizing NSM Components with SPIRE" %}}
In the course of normal operation, many different NSM components touch the control and data paths. Any one of
these services could be compromised to modify or capture network traffic. To prevent this, NSM can use SPIRE, a
CNCF project which creates a secure X.509 encryption certificate for each service based on its true identity as
reported by Kubernetes (or other infrastructure like AWS), interpreted by rules specified in the SPIRE configuration.
In this talk, we will discuss what NSM operators need to know about SPIRE: how it ensures security, how to configure
it to secure NSM traffic, and how to operate a scalable and reliable central SPIRE server in the context of NSM.

Тhe NSM project already announced its second release and is now in a pretty good stage of capabilities it can offer,
including inter-domain connectivity, DNS support, secure gRPC communication and more. It also provides communication
visibility of dropped and successfully transmitted bytes and packets between each connected client and endpoint.
The community would like to go further and provide a really good and interactive way to observe the network traffic
and topology - something we find highly beneficial and important for increasing the adoption of the project. In this
talk we’re going to share different visualization solutions we have explored for NSM, demonstrate some of them with
a 4G LTE network example deployed with NSM, share the path for their further integration and what we want to change
and improve in that direction. The talk is aiming to provoke a discussion around the preferences of those interested
in adopting the project and using such functionality in future.

SDWAN provides WAN optimization services such as latency reduction, throughput improvement, TCP optimization, and
packet loss prevention. However, existing solutions can’t  offer such services with microservices granularity. As a
result, cloud native applications are missing the opportunity to efficiently use those precious WAN resources on both
the user-to-app as well as the app-to-app path. In this presentation we introduce the concept of a Cloud-Native WAN,
the evolution of SDWAN to support cloud-native applications. In particular we show how to leverage the NSM forwarder
construct to plug a microservice application to the entry point of an SDWAN to offer optimizations with microservice
granularity. The proposed approach allows developers to declare specific application traffic SLAs using simple
configurations applied to the application workload objects. We show a proof of concept implementation where using
CN-WAN significantly improves the application quality of experience.

In this session, Zia Syed and Dan Bernier will present an NSM Customer Success story! After meeting at NSMCon 2019,
Bell and Cisco partnered together to combine their NSM visions. In this session, Zia and Dan will present how they
took NSM proof-of-concept ideas and made them into functional use-cases that benefit Bell’s business goals.

At first, the NSM solution was one that enabled container-based applications to request their own network 
"Quality of Experience" using a SDN system nicknamed “Jalapeno”. The combination allowed NSM to offer services such as 
traffic engineering, path steering, or even virtual topology creation to containerized applications. Since then,
the use-cases have grown, with L3-VPN taking center stage as an NSM service created out of this partnership.
One of Bell’s key use cases is to attach a cloud-native network function (NFV) endpoint directly to an L3VPN VRF.
With NSM we can do this!

# Why Attend NSMCon?
{{< img-text img="/img/events/NSMCon1.png">}}
Are you running workloads in multiple clusters? Across multiple clouds: on-premises, hybrid, multi-cloud, or public cloud? Do they need to interact with legacy workloads running in less “cloudy” environments? Network Service Mesh (NSM) ties them all together, at the granularity of individual workloads, not clusters/VPCs/data centers. 

NSM, a community-driven CNCF Sandbox project, is rapidly gaining momentum because simplifies connectivity between workloads, independent of where they run. It extends an IP reachability domain to workloads running in multiple clusters, legacy environments, on-premises, or in a public cloud, communicating with the existing protocols.

NSM does this at the granularity of individual workloads. Your workloads have connectivity to just the workloads they need - nothing more, nothing less. NSM brings the useful features of a Service Mesh from the lofty heights of HTTP all the way down to IP itself. Applications and Application Service Meshes, such as Istio, run unaltered on top, leaving the hybrid/multicloud IP connectivity to NSM.

The project emerged organically as a community project to solve these problems by applying the Service Mesh thought process all the way down to IP with the global peering mentality of the Internet itself – without breaking your existing environment.

Join the people building and using NSM at Network Service Mesh Con for a day of tutorials, deep dives, and use cases to learn how NSM works, what it can do for you, and, most importantly, what’s coming next.
